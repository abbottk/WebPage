# Research

The way we *think* about programs, and the way we *communicate* programs (from user to machine, as well as from user to user and machine to user) are disconnected to some degree. This disconnection makes it difficult for humans to reason about programs written for computers, and likewise computers to reason about programs written for humans. As a result, a significant barrier still exists in achieving true *mixed-initiative execution* in programs we write. Often the types of programs we think of as *mixed-initiative* contain controls *dominated* either the computer, or the human user.

I believe **[domain-specific languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)** and **[natural language programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_programming)** can assist us in connecting humans with computers in ways we haven't yet explored.

## Projects

* **[More to Come](/projects/more-to-come.html)** <br> There are some things I am working on that I am hoping will yeild some interesting project opportunities, so stay tuned!
