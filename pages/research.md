# Research

The way we think about *programs*, and the way we *communicate programs* (from user to machine, as well as from user to user and machine to user) are disconnected to some degree.

This disconnection can make it difficult for domain experts who are not programmers by training to create clear algorithms for the machine to interpret. Domain-specific languages, and natural language programming can help us understand this disconnection, and help us bridge some of that gap.

## Projects

* **[More to Come](/projects/more-to-come.html)** <br> There are some things I am working on that I am hoping will yeild some interesting project opportunities, so stay tuned!
