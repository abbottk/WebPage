title: SIGPLAN Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop at ICFP
---

I am pleased to be able to attend the [*SIGPLAN Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop at ICFP*](http://icfpconference.org/icfp2015/), as well as the [full conference](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sweirich/icfp-plmw15/) in August/September 2015. As a result, I will also be able to attend [*Haskell Symposium 2015*](https://www.haskell.org/haskell-symposium/2015/). Really looking forward to it.
