I am very excited to announce that I will be teaching [CS 381 Programming Language Fundamentals](teaching/cs381-su15) this summer! Lectures will be Monday through Friday from 4:00--4:50 pm in KEC 1003. More details to follow as we get closer to the term, but if you haven't already signed up, make sure you do!
