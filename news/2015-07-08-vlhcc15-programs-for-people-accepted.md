title: Protocol Study Paper accepted to VLHCC
---

With Christopher Bogart, and Eric Walkingshaw, our paper "Programs for People: What We Can Learn from Lab Protocols" was accepted to the [*IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing*](https://sites.google.com/site/vlhcc2015/). This is a great result for me, as it is the first conference paper I have been involved with. In addition to the main contribution, this paper has provided a framework for future contributions.
