## Course Description and Syllabus {#desc}

CS 381, Programming Languages Fundamentals, is a four-credit course for undergraduate students. The course introduces concepts found in a variety of programming languages and exposes students to non-imperative programming paradigms. Topics to be covered include: Haskell, Prolog, syntax, scoping, parameter passing, types, polymorphism, exception handling, semantics.

The syllabus for the course is linked below. It includes the course learning objectives and much of the information contained on this web page. Note that if the schedule changes during the quarter, the web page will reflect the revised schedule but the syllabus will not be updated.

## Slides and Code Examples {#slides}

Slides and code examples from the lectures will be posted below. Slides will normally be posted just before class, and completed files just after. I will continue to update the slides for each stage of the course until we are done with that stage.

## Homework Assignments {#hw}

Homework Assignments are submitted through [TEACH](http://engr.oregonstate.edu/teach) *as well as* a printed copy submitted in class. Log in and click "Submit Assignment" in the navigation bar on the right, located under "Class Tools." You should see a list of currently open submissions.

Note that due to logistical issues **late homework will not be accepted**. Please be sure to submit your assignments on time.

 * [Homework #1](homework/hw1.html) --- due: June 26, 11:59pm
 * [Homework #2](homework/hw2.html) --- due: July 2, 3:59pm
 * [Homework #3](homework/hw3.html) --- due: July 9, 3:59pm
 * [Homework #4](homework/hw4.html) --- due: July 16, 3:59pm
 * [Homework #5](homework/hw5.html) --- due: August 6, 3:59pm

## Use of Piazza {#piazza}

Instead of a traditional mailing list, we’ll be using Piazza. You should sign up for Piazza and join the class page ASAP so that you don’t miss any important announcements!

**[CS 381 on Piazza](https://piazza.com/oregonstate/summer2015/cs381)**

The main motivation for using Piazza is its Q&A platform, which is geared toward students helping other students. Anybody can post or answer a question, and you can even do so anonymously if you’re shy. The instructor and TA can then revise (if needed) and endorse student answers so you can be confident in the quality of the response.

Students are *strongly encouraged* to post their questions to Piazza first, and to frequently check back and answer other students’ questions. Not only will this enable everyone to get help quickly, but teaching someone else is the best way to learn something, so you’ll be improving your understanding of the material as well.

As a little external incentive, a few points of *extra credit* will be awarded at the end of the class to active Piazza participants.

## Grading and Homework Policy {#grading}

Grades will be computed using the following weights. Each student's lowest quiz score will be dropped.

 * 20% Quizzes
 * 20% Homework
 * 25% Midterm exam
 * 35% Final exam

All **quizzes and exams** are closed book and closed notes. Quizzes will be held on Mondays, and exams will be held on Thursdays -- there is no specified finals schedule for Summer term so the final will be held during the **last class meeting of the term**.

Teamwork on **homework** is allowed and *encouraged*. Teams of two or three students may submit a common homework as long as all members are clearly identified on the submission. All students in a team must contribute to the team solution and will receive the same grade. *Adding the name of a student who has not contributed to a solution will be regarded as cheating*. All team members must be able to explain their homework contribution to the instructor.

Note that due to logistical issues **late homework will not be accepted**. Please be sure to submit your assignments on time.

## Links and Useful Resources {#links}

There is no textbook for this course. However, there are several resources online which you may find useful.

### Haskell

Throughout most of the course, we will use the functional programming language [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/). In particular, we will use Haskell as a *metalanguage* for explaining general programming language concepts. It is therefore absolutely *essential* that you develop your Haskell programming skills!

In addition to the graded homework assignments and the ungraded exercises provided during class, I strongly recommend that you consult another Haskell resource and write Haskell programs outside of class. The following resources should provide several options.

#### Running Haskell Code {#install}

  * [Haskell Compiler and base libraries](https://www.haskell.org/platform/) -- The easiest way to start using Haskell. I will assume you have this installed!

  * [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/) -- The central package archive for the Haskell community. There are lots of useful libraries here. Install them using the cabal tool, which comes with the Haskell Platform. First, run the following command to download the list of packages on Hackage.

>>`cabal update`

>Then you can install new packages by running the following command.

>>`cabal install [package-name]`

  * [How to cabal install](https://www.fpcomplete.com/user/simonmichael/how-to-cabal-install) -- A longer tutorial about installing packages from Hackage, in case you run into problems.

  * [Doctest](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/doctest) -- A useful tool for running examples in comments as unit tests. We’ll use this occasionally in Homework assignments. You can install `doctest` using `cabal install doctest`, as described above.

    You will probably also need to add the installation directory to your `$$PATH`. Here are my best guesses as to where that will be:

    * Linux: `~/.cabal/bin`
    * Mac: `~/Library/Haskell/bin`
    * Windows: `C:\Program Files\Haskell\bin`

#### Haskell Tutorials and Reference Manuals {#tutorials}

  * [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) -- This is a great, fun tutorial that starts from the very beginning. I recommend that if you are completely new to functional programming, you read and work through this tutorial.

  * [Haskell: The Confusing Parts](http://echo.rsmw.net/n00bfaq.html) -- An FAQ especially for folks coming to Haskell from a C/Java background, which I guess is most of the people in this class.

  * [Real World Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/) -- O’Reilly’s book-length introduction to Haskell focusing on practical applications. Available for free online.

  * [A Gentle Intrduction to Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/tutorial/) -- Famous for being not-so-gentle, but a really great resource for refining your understanding of Haskell, once you get the basics down.

  * [Haskell 2010 Language Report](https://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/haskell2010/) -- The latest version of the definitive Haskell reference manual.

#### Haskell Style {#style}

  * The Haskell wiki contains several pages concerned with style. Start with the general [programming guidelines](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Programming_guidelines). Answers to more specific questions can be found by querying the [Style category listing](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Category:Style).

### Prolog

In the last couple weeks of the course, we will use the logic programming language [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog). As with Haskell, I strongly recommend you supplement the course material with reading and exercises outside of class.

  * [SWI-Prolog](http://www.swi-prolog.org/download/stable) -– The Prolog environment we’ll be using. I’ll assume you have this installed.

  * [Learn Prolog Now!](http://www.learnprolognow.org) -- This book provides a good introduction to Prolog and plenty of exercises for practice. Available for free online.

  * [An Introduction to Logic Programming through Prolog](https://spivey.oriel.ox.ac.uk/corner/Logic_Programming) -- A free older textbook based on Prolog. I haven’t read this one but it looks like a pretty good resource.

  * [Prolog Wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Prolog) -- Another one I haven’t read, but looks like a pretty good resource.
