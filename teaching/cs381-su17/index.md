## Course Description and Essentials {#desc}

CS 381, Programming Languages Fundamentals, is a four-credit course for undergraduate students. The course introduces concepts found in a variety of programming languages and exposes students to non-imperative programming paradigms. Topics to be covered include: Haskell, Prolog, syntax, scoping, parameter passing, types, polymorphism, exception handling, semantics.

  * [Course Syllabus](files/syllabus.pdf) -- Includes the course learning objectives and much of the information contained on this page. Note that if the schedule changes during the term, the web page will reflect the revised schedule but the syllabus will not be updated.
  * [Haskell and Prolog Resources](links.html) -- How to get up and running with Haskell and Prolog. Also lists of several tutorials, freely available books, and other resources that you should use to supplement the content in this class.
  * [Community Statement](community.hmtl) -- Every student should feel safe and welcome to contribute in this course. Please read this statement and let's work together to make this a great environment for everyone.
  * [Grading and Homework Policy](policy.html) -- How grades will be computed and course policy on homework, quizzes, and exams.
