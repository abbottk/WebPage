## Grading and Homework Policy {#grading}

Grades will be computed using the following weights. Each student's lowest quiz score will be dropped.

 * 25% Homework (5x5%)
 * 15% Quizzes (4x3.75%) -- 5 quizzes, lowest score dropped
 * 30% Midterm exam
 * 30% Final exam

For **90%** or more, you will receive an **"A"**; for less than **30%** you will receive an **"F"**. The remaining grades are assigned linearly in between. I might lift grades if clustering of points achieved by students suggests so, but I won't assign grades worse than indicated by the above linear schema). For those who are too lazy to do the calculations, you can look up the grades on [this table](files/grading_schema.pdf).

All **quizzes and exams** are closed book and closed notes. Quizzes will be held on Mondays, and exams will be held on Thursdays -- there is no specified finals schedule for Summer term so the final will be held during the **last class meeting of the term**.

Teamwork on **homework** is allowed and *encouraged*. Teams of two or three students may submit a common homework as long as all members are clearly identified on the submission. All students in a team must contribute to the team solution and will receive the same grade. *Adding the name of a student who has not contributed to a solution will be regarded as cheating*. All team members must be able to explain their homework contribution to the instructor.

Note that due to logistical issues **late homework is not accepted**. Be sure to submit your assignments on time.
