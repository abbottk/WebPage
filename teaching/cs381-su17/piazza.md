# Use of Piazza {#piazza}

Instead of a traditional mailing list, we’ll be using Piazza. You should sign up for Piazza and join the class page ASAP so that you don’t miss any important announcements!

**[CS 381 on Piazza](https://piazza.com/oregonstate/summer2017/cs381)**

The main motivation for using Piazza is its Q&A platform, which is geared toward students helping other students. Anybody can post or answer a question, and you can even do so anonymously if you’re shy. The instructor and TA can then revise (if needed) and endorse student answers so you can be confident in the quality of the response.

Students are *strongly encouraged* to post their questions to Piazza first, and to frequently check back and answer other students’ questions. Not only will this enable everyone to get help quickly, but teaching someone else is the best way to learn something, so you’ll be improving your understanding of the material as well.

As a little external incentive, a few points of *extra credit* will be awarded at the end of the class to active Piazza participants.
