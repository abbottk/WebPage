title: Research Overview
---

Currently I am interested in the space where *human computation* and *machine computation* intersect or overlap. I am particularly interested in the design of *mixed-initiative execution* systems, where control of and decisions about the process flow are influenced by both the human user, and the computer (and not dominated by one or the other). To this end, I am especially interested in the design of **[domain-specific languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)**, and **[natural language programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_programming)**.
