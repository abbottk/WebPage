title: Research Overview
---

Currently I am interested in the space where *human computation* and *machine computation* intersect or overlap. I am particularly interested in the design of *mixed-initiative execution* systems, where control of and decisions about the control flow are influenced by both the human actor, and the machine (and not dominated by one or the other). To this end, I am especially interested in the design of **[domain-specific languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)** and **[active learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning)** applications in computer science.
