title: Research Overview
---

Currently I am interested in the space where *human computation* and *machine computation* intersect or overlap. Such as on an assembly line where workers have to execute a sequence of steps in concert with machinery or computers, or in the use of tools like **[Amazon Mechanical Turk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Mechanical_Turk)** where some of the necessary information gathering and classification is outsources to humans. To this end, I am especially interested in the design of **[domain-specific languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)**, and **[natural language programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_programming)**.
